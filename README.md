### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer at [PipeBio](https://pipebio.com/).

My background is in Bioinformatics / Computational Biology (more info about my
[PhD dissertation](https://romanhaa.github.io/phd_thesis/)).
Single cell data analysis is one of my specialties (see my
[workflow](https://romanhaa.github.io/projects/scrnaseq_workflow/)).


I love Data Visualization (see my galleries of
[plots](https://romanhaa.github.io/plots/) and
[maps](https://github.com/romanhaa/plot-maps)) and am equally enthusiastic about
the frontend and backend stack.
