<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

I'm a Software Engineer and [Open Targets](https://www.opentargets.org/) Specialist working at [The Hyve](https://thehyve.nl/).

My background is in Bioinformatics / Computational Biology (more info about my [PhD dissertation](https://romanhaa.github.io/phd_thesis/)).
 
I love Data Visualization (see my galleries of [plots](https://romanhaa.github.io/plots/) and [maps](https://github.com/romanhaa/plot-maps)).

Single cell analysis is one of my specialties (see my [workflow](https://romanhaa.github.io/projects/scrnaseq_workflow/)).
